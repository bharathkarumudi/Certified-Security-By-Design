# Certified-Security-By-Design
Certified Security By Design using Higher Order Logic (HOL) Theorem Prover and Meta Language!!

### Introduction

- Foundational theory, concepts, and computer-assisted reasoning tools necessary for assurance.
- The engineering of assured systems requires the capability to rigorously specify and verify system behavior. When constructing physical systems, one can use physical principles as the basis of calculations that demonstrate oneâ€™s claims are correct.

### Usage:
#### Comprehension
- When given a mathematical or logical expression, be able to explain its meaning and discuss the interpretation.
- When given a mathematical or logical definition or property, be able to restate it in a functional programming language, such as ML, or theorem prover, such as HOL.

#### Application
- When given an informal or mathematical specification, use ML to create an executable version of the specification.
- When given an informal or mathematical specification, use HOL to restate the specification in higher-order logic.
- When given the abstract syntax of a language and its operational semantics, restate the syntax and semantics in both ML and HOL.
- When given an access-control description, concept of operations, or policy, restate the descriptions, concepts of operations, and policies in HOL.

#### Analysis
- When given proposed properties in structural operational semantics (SOS) or access control logic (ACL), use the rules of SOS or ACL to prove (or disprove) the proposed properties.
- When given proposed properties, use HOL to verify the properties hold.

#### Synthesis
- When given an informal specification, definition, or property, construct (in ML or HOL) appropriate data types, predicates, functions, and semantic rules that correctly and fully describe the specification, definition, or property.

#### Evaluation
- When given a proposed proof using SOS or ACL, assess if the proof is correct using the rules of SOS or ACL.
